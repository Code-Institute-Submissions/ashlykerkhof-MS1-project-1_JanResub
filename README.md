  <h3 align="center">Ashly Kerkhof Acting Page</h3>

  <p align="center">
    The idea is too make it so accessable that people will be able to see the work i have done,
    plus all of the information about me such as; my career and life, my cv, my showreel and all of my headshots in one place.</p>
<p align="center">
    inspiriation was taken from a lot of portfolios on the interent, i looked at many acting pages, and took inspiration from the things i liked,
    such as the hover gallery. I really wanted it to be slick and accessible to everyone.

<!-- User Experience-->

## UX

The project is designed for the use of actors to portray their work to casting directors and directors alike. The website will showcase all of the actors work and achievements, while also keeping the casting directors attention using specific interaction.
The idea of the site is to make it easier for people to find the actors work rather than having to go through links and doing their own research, as you can see from the site, everything is compact and easy to use. 
The layout is all on one page to make it easier to traverse and keep the user interested, a nav bar has been situated at the top as well to easily swap between tabs making it quick and easy to get to where they need to go.
In my mind this is the best way for an actor to martket themselves.

## User Stories

A couple of things i would want as a user;

1. I want to be able to traverse the page simply, so i can see all i need to see without wasting to much time.
2. i want to see everything on one page so i don't have to load up different tabs to favourite the work.
3. i want to be able to contact the actor using the contact button at the moment, i'd also like to be able to contact the agent if needed.
4. i want the gallery to be interactive and appealing to the eye, so i can scroll through pictures quick and easy.

### Testing/Bugs

Done a few tests recently to see if the code was up to scratch, noticed certan things from the test;

1. Certain code was not processing and there was no need to have it in the project so i removed, such as... background-shadow: or text-shadow: 

This now been editted and updated on the page.

2. a bug that was really annoying me before was the overhang of the landing page picture. it was hanging over the right hand side of the website on both phone and desktop, i couldn't work out why. Spent a long time googling to realise i hadn't set the right measurements in the CSS file, a simple number change and i managed to sort it. However further on during the coding, i decided to change the landing page to have a carousel, which in its self rectified my problem.

3. all audio links, video links and external links all work however, the send email doesn't yet. advancing through the course i did com across the emailjs and api so will rectify this later in my coding journey.

4. navbar doesn't disappear once you have clicked on it on the mobile screen, the way to get rid out it is by clicking the tab which you want to go then pressing the burger on the nav bar, you will notice it takes you to the tab. Hasn't been rectified yet.
